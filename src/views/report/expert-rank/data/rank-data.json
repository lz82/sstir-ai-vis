From 1961 to 1990 he worked at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow, where he became Head of the Computer Science Research Department. He then joined AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, having been appointed Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at Royal Holloway in 1995.  Professor Vapnik has taught and researched in computer science, theoretical and applied statistics for over 30 years. He has published 6 monographs and over a hundred research papers. His major achievements have been the development of a general theory of minimizing the expected risk using empirical data and a new type of learning machine called Support Vector machine that possesses a high level of generalization ability. These techniques have been used to solve many pattern recognition and regression estimation problems and have been applied to the problems of dependency estimation, forecasting, and constructing intelligent machines. His current research is presented in his latest books \"Statistical Learning Theory\", Wiley, 1998, and \"The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory\", second edition, Springer, 2000.  He was one of the invited speakers at the Colloquium \"The Importance of being Learnable\" hosted by the Computer Learning Research Centre at Royal Holloway in September 1998.  On the 10th of February 2006 the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) of USA elected Professor Vapnik as a new member for \"insights into the fundamental complexities of learning and for inventing practical and widely applied machine-learning algorithms\".  The citation states that:  \"Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to \"engineering research, practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature,\" and to the \"pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education\".

Among other features, the WPR team provides query suggestions, determines how results are arranged on the page, and measures overall user satisfaction.     Paul came to Microsoft as a Researcher in 2002.  Before moving to Search, Paul and his team worked on numerous efforts to use machine learning in the analysis of documents, emails, and web pages.  Results of this work can be seen in products like Windows, Live Search, and Microsoft Dynamics.  In collaboration with the Live Toolbar team we built the technology behind \u201csmart menus\u201d.  The Tablet PC team uses our technology to extract the structure in handwritten ink notes.  East Asian Office is using his technology to extract contact information from incoming emails.  Dynamics/CRM is using his technology to automatically route and analyze incoming faxes.   Live Search uses similar technology to classify and extract information from documents and queries.     Paul has served on the program committees of conferences such as Neural Information Process Systems (NIPS), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), and the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).  He has received the Marr Prize for the best paper in computer vision (at ICCV 2003).  An earlier paper on medical image processing received an honorable mention for the Marr prize in 1995.  He received an honorable mention for best paper at AAAI 2004. While at MIT he received the NSF Career award as one of the top junior faculty members in Computer Science.     Paul\u2019s interest in intelligent systems goes back quite a ways.  As an IBM intern in 1986, Paul Viola constructed a semi-autonomous robotic wheel chair called \u201cMr. Ed\u201d.  This ride-on robot incorporated sensors and a microprocessor,  and required no more than coarse and infrequent feedback to navigate a hallway,  or go through a doorway.  Until 1990,  he studied robotics with Rod Brooks at MIT.  There he received a master\u2019s degree for the construction of an autonomous visual robot patterned on the simple mammalian oculomotor processes.  After brief forays into neuroscience and structural molecular biology (at Arris Phamaceutical now Axys), Paul returned to MIT to complete his Ph.D. on biomedical image processing.     Paul\u2019s thesis work on the registration of images from various medical sensors has been widely used and reimplemented (his thesis has been referenced more than 800 times).  It is now a standard technique that appears in many commercial products,  and is widely considered the best and most reliable registration technique for assistance in surgical planning.       In 1995, Dr. Viola returned to MIT as an assistant professor and later an associate professor.  His work focused on statistical learning for image processing and computer vision.   In the area of computer graphics his work with Jeremy De Bonet is considered the first effective texture synthesis algorithm for complex textural patterns.  Other work included techniques for image database retrieval and 3D reconstruction.     While visiting Compaq Cambridge research labs in 2000,  he created the world\u2019s first real-time face detection system.  This system has been widely adopted and reimplemented: Intel distributes this algorithm in a computer vision toolkit;  MSRA has adopted and improved the algorithm.  Though it was developed outside of MS, it is actually in wide use inside of MSR (as well as many other companies and universities).  After leaving MIT to join the Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, he worked on face recognition, surveillance, and real-time computer vision. ",

    "BIO": "I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Prof. Luc Van Gool's group. My main interests are object detection and tracking from moving platforms in urban scenarios, as well as SLAM and 3D reconstruction.  When observing a traffic scene from inside a vehicle, a human observer will usually pay attention to a multitude of different scene objects in parallel: one can identify other traffic agents such as cars and pedestrians, and predict their further motion, or even interpret their intention. At the same time, one needs to stay clear of any obstacles, remain on the assigned road, and read/interpret any traffic signs on the side of street. On top that, a human is able to assess the situation: when close to a school or pedestrian crossing, one ideally will adapt one's driving behavior.  While humans seem to be able to perform all these tasks in parallel without too much effort, urban scene analysis remains a difficult task for a computer. To this end, I have been working on various projects towards this goal, mostly looking at specific sub-problems and combining them in a system's perspective.  Most of my work has been published at major conferences/journals in the Computer Vision and Robotics communities. Together with my co-authors Bastian Leibe, Konrad Schindler, and Luc Van Gool, we have obtained the Best Vision Paper Award at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), held in Kobe, May 2009! The rewarded work finds and tracks pedestrians in realistic shopping street environments, from a mobile platform (either a car or a robot-like platform).",

    "BIO": "I finished my Ph.D. in computer vision at The University of Chicago under the supervision of Pedro Felzenszwalb in April 2012. Then, I spent two unbelievably wonderful years as a postdoc at UC Berkeley under Jitendra Malik. From Berkeley, I spent just over one year as a Researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond. Now, I'm off on a new adventure as a Research Scientist with the terrific group of researchers and engineers in Facebook AI Research (FAIR).   My main research interests are in computer vision, AI, and machine learning. I'm particularly focused on building models for object detection and recognition. These models aim to incorporate the \"right\" biases so that machine learning algorithms can understand image content from moderate to large-scale datasets. I always have an eye towards fast systems that work well in practice.   During my Ph.D., I spent time as a research intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK working on human pose estimation from (Kinect) depth images. I also participated in several first-place entries into the PASCAL VOC object detection challenge, and was awarded a \"lifetime achievement\" prize for my work on deformable part models. I think this refers to the lifetime of the PASCAL challenge\u2014and not mine!",

    "BIO": "David Haussler (born 1953) is an American bioinformatician known for his work leading the team that assembled the first human genome sequence in the race to complete the Human Genome Project and subsequently for compDavid Haussler\u2019s research lies at the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology. He develops new statistical and algorithmic methods to explore the molecular function and evolution of the human genome, integrating cross-species comparative and high-throughput genomics data to study gene structure, function, and regulation. He is credited with pioneering the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs), stochastic context-free grammars, and the discriminative kernel method for analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. He was the first to apply the latter methods to the genome-wide search for gene expression biomarkers in cancer, now a major effort of his laboratory.  As a collaborator on the international Human Genome Project, his team posted the first publicly available computational assembly of the human genome sequence on the Internet on July 7, 2000. Following this, his team developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a web-based tool that is used extensively in biomedical research and serves as the platform for several large-scale genomics projects, including NHGRI\u2019s ENCODE project to use omics methods to explore the function of every base in the human genome, NIH\u2019s Mammalian Gene Collection, NHGRI\u2019s 1000 genomes project to explore human genetic variation, and NCI\u2019s Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to explore the genomic changes in cancer.  His group\u2019s informatics work on cancer genomics, including the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, provides a complete analysis pipeline from raw DNA reads through the detection and interpretation of mutations and altered gene expression in tumor samples. His group collaborates with researchers at medical centers nationally, including members of the Stand Up To Cancer \u201cDream Teams\u201d and the Cancer Genome Atlas, to discover molecular causes of cancer and pioneer a new personalized, genomics-based approach to cancer treatment.  The UCSC Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a product of the Haussler lab, is a secure repository for storing, cataloging, and accessing cancer genome sequences, alignments, and mutation information for 25 cancer types from TCGA, the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) project, and other related projects. The current planned capacity of this data center is five petabytes. The CGHub will serve as a platform to aggregate other large-scale cancer genomics information, growing to provide the statistical power to attack the complexity of cancer.  He co-founded the Genome 10K Project to assemble a genomic zoo\u2014a collection of DNA sequences representing the genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species\u2014to capture genetic diversity as a resource for the life sciences and for worldwide conservation efforts.  Haussler co-founded and co-chairs the Data Working Group of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, through which research, health care, and disease advocacy organizations that have taken the first steps to standardize and enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data.   Haussler received his PhD in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of AAAS and AAAI. He has won a number of awards, including the 2015 Dan David Prize, the 2011 Weldon Memorial Prize from University of Oxford, the 2009 ASHG Curt Stern Award in Human Genetics, the 2008 Senior Scientist Accomplishment Award from the International Society for Computational Biology, the 2005 Dickson Prize for Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award in Artificial Intelligence.",

In 1979 he spent a year interning at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas, and the Biomath department at Oxford University. He joined the Ph.D program at Stanford University in 1980. After graduating from Stanford in 1984, he returned to South Africa for a year with his earlier employer SA Medical Research Council. He returned to the USA in March 1986 and joined the statistics and data analysis research group at what was then AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. After eight years at Bell Labs, he returned to Stanford University in 1994 as Professor in Statistics and Biostatistics. In 2013 he was named the John A. Overdeck Professor of Mathematical Sciences.  His main research contributions have been in applied statistics, and he has written three books in this area: \"Generalized Additive Models\" (with R. Tibshirani, Chapman and Hall, 1991), \"Elements of Statistical Learning\" (with R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, Springer 2001; second edition 2009) and \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R\" (with G. James, D. Witten and R. Tibshirani, Springer 2013). He has also made contributions in statistical computing, co-editing (with J. Chambers) a large software library on modeling tools in the S language (\"Statistical Models in S\", Wadsworth, 1992), which form the foundation for much of the statistical modeling in R. His current research focuses on applied statistical modeling and prediction problems in biology and genomics, medicine and industry.",

    "BIO": "I was born in Edinburgh in 1971, but moved to Brighton aged 3, and stayed there until I finished school, except for one year (1980) in Perros Guirec, a small town on the coast of Brittany (Northern France). My parents are both American, and have now moved back to Edinburgh and when people ask me where I'm from, I usually say Brighton. I lived in San Francisco for six months in 1990 and again in 1994, working first in a muscle physiology lab at UCSF, and later for the Digital Equipment Co. Systems Research Center in Palo Alto. I lived in Capetown for three months in 1994 working as a volunteer at the Grassroots Educare Trust. In 1990 I went to King's College, Cambridge University, to read maths. I had a great time there, and got the opportunity to design some posters (lots of big images). On graduation, I spent 6 months living in Cambridge working as a research assistant at the Newton Institute and learning about computer vision.   Since January 1995 I have been studying for a D.Phil. (Ph.D.) in computer vision at Wolfson College, Oxford University.   ",

Floyd is also a co-author on the standard for TCP Selective acknowledgement (SACK), Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN), the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) and TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). She received the IEEE Internet Award in 2005 and the ACM SIGCOMM Award in 2007 for her contributions to congestion control.[1] She has been involved in the Internet Advisory Board, and is one of the top-ten most cited researchers in computer science.",

    "BIO": "I grew up in Germany, and moved to the United States in 1990 to join the PhD program in Computer Science at Cornell University. I quickly came to like the new country, especially the friendly people and the exciting weather (both blizzards and 100-degree days are things one rarely encounters in Germany). While at Cornell, I met my wife Amy Briggs, whom I followed to Middlebury to teach computer science. My research is in computer vision, the field concerned with analyzing images (which might be taken with a video camera). I'm particularly interested in stereo vision, i.e., extracting 3D information from two 2D images. (Take CS 453 if you want to learn more about this!) I'm also interested in computer graphics and computer architecture. I have great fun teaching computer science, in particular how to program. Having to achieve the \"perfection\" required to write a working program can be a mind-bending intellectual experience!  To get my mind off work, I love to play music. My main instrument is the drums, but I also play many other instruments (with varying levels of skill :). At Middlebury I play \"Vermonto-Rican Folk-Rock for the Hard-of-Hearing\" with The Doughboys, and also with the jazz/latin/fusion group Mogani and the band Soularium. While at Cornell, I was the drummer with the CS department's rock band Harmful if Swallowed.  I have fun inventing and building things, often with rather non-traditional applications. I have started a company that builds and sells digital sundials. I also enjoy juggling (with Profs. Schumer and Briggs), unicycling, and hiking and skiing in our lovely state.",

    "BIO": "John Denker was an undergrad at Caltech. During his junior year, he founded a successful small software and electronics company which did pioneering work in many fields including security systems, Hollywood special effects, hand-held electronic games, and video games. Also while still an undergrad, he created and taught a course at Caltech: \u201cDesigning with Microprocessors\u201d.  His doctoral research at Cornell examined the properties of a gas of hydrogen atoms at temperatures only a few thousandths of a degree above absolute zero, and showed that quantum spin transport and long-lived \u201cspin wave\u201d resonances occur in this dilute Bose gas. Other research concerned the design of ultra-low-noise measuring devices, in which the fundamental quantum-mechanical limitations play an important role.  Dr. Denker joined AT&T Bell Laboratories and worked there for many years, serving in roles including Distinguished Member of Technical Staff, Department Head, and Division Manager. His research interests include computer security, internet telephony, and \u201cneural networks\u201d \u2013 combining ideas from biology, physics, computer science, and statistics in order to devise new types of information processing systems. He has also invented novel low-energy \u201cadiabatic\u201d computing systems.  In 1986-87 he was Visiting Professor at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (University of California, Santa Barbara). He has served on the organizing committee of several major scientific conferences.  He holds numerous patents and has written over 50 research papers and one book chapter, and edited the book Neural Networks for Computing. He has lectured widely.  He is well known as a prankster and prototypical mad scientist. Some of his exploits were featured in the films \u201cReal Genius\u201d and \u201cThe Age Seeking for Genius\u201d, as well as in publications such as \u201cTime\u201d and \u201cIEEE Spectrum\u201d.  John Denker is certified as a Commercial Pilot, Flight Instructor, and Ground Instructor. He is an FAA Aviation Safety Counselor.

He is Associate Professor at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management, where he teaches the core MBA Operations course. He was on the faculty of the Harvard Business School from 2004-2010, where he taught the core MBA course in Technology and Operations Management, and he co-developed and taught the Operations Strategy elective course. He has taught in executive education programs at HBS, including Building Competitive Advantage through Operations (BCAO), Leading Product Innovation (LPI), and Senior Executive Program, China (SEPC). He has also taught executive education programs at UCLA, Tsinghua University, Chalmers University, University of Xiamen, Universidad de La Sabana (Bogot\u00e1), and many others. Professor Snow's research seeks to improve our understanding of technological innovation, and specifically of the complex relationship between new and old technologies that exists during technology transitions. While most work on technology and innovation has taken a \"neo-phillic\" approach, focusing largely on issues surrounding adoption of new and emerging technologies, Professor Snow's work highlights the economic and performance growth potential of \"old\" technologies. Many old technologies, from incandescent light bulbs, wood building products, and blackboards, to Apollo rocket motors, CISC computer chips, and lead-acid batteries, continue to prosper and improve at unexpectedly fast rates. Firms that rely on these and other old technologies face a unique set of challenges as they seek to improve their current offers. These challenges becomes even more complex for firms that rely on both old and new technologies. Snow's work seeks to improve scholarly understanding of the complex interplay between old and new technologies, and to provide managers with tools to navigate technology transitions effectively.  He holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business and an MBA from BYU's Marriott School of Management. He has worked for Ford Motor Company as a financial analyst, and he advises firms facing decisions about Research and Development, technology transitions, and the issues associated with new technology adoption.",

He invented statistical parametric mapping (SPM), voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM). These contributions were motivated by schizophrenia research and theoretical studies of value-learning, formulated as the dysconnection hypothesis of schizophrenia. Mathematical contributions include variational Laplacian procedures and generalized filtering for hierarchical Bayesian model inversion. Friston currently works on models of functional integration in the human brain and the principles that underlie neuronal interactions. His main contribution to theoretical neurobiology is a free-energy principle for action and perception (active inference). Friston received the first Young Investigators Award in Human Brain Mapping (1996) and was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (1999). In 2000 he was President of the international Organization of Human Brain Mapping. In 2003 he was awarded the Minerva Golden Brain Award and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2006.

    "BIO": "Computational learning theory and related areas in probability theory, information theory, statistics and pattern recognition. Yoav Freund works on applications of machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics, computer vision, finance, network routing and high-performance computing. He has developed a new approach to the study and development of machine learning algorithms, where the goal is to produce a good decision algorithm for a repetitive decision task. A decision algorithm receives as input an instance (sensory data) and outputs a decision (an action). After the decision has been made, there is a measurable outcome. Freund's main focus is on binary classification tasks, where the decision is binary, the outcome is binary, and the loss is 1 if the decision and outcome don't match and 0 if they do. Given these definitions and a source of instances and outcomes, Freund can evaluate the performance of any decision algorithm--treating it as a \"black box\". The practical advantage of the black-box approach is that it provides a measuring stick for comparing all types of decision algorithms, regardless of how they are constructed or analyzed. By extension, this approach produces a way of comparing all types of learning algorithms. Capsule Bio: Yoav Freund is a professor of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. His work is in the area of machine learning, computational statistics and their applications. Dr. Freund is an internationally known researcher in the field of machine learning, a field which bridges computer science and statistics. He is best known for his joint work with Dr. Robert Schapire on the Adaboost algorithm.

    "BIO": "I studied Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi where a thesis on the automatic recognition of beats on the Tabla got me interested in the themes of perception, recognition, learning on the one hand and acoustics, music, and language on the other. I came to study at the Laboratory for Computer Science at MIT where I completed a master's thesis on speech recognition. A taste for theoretical problems and a desire to better understand fundamental possibilities and limitations of automatic learning and recognition by a computer led me to a Ph.D. in learning theory that I submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. During the MIT years, I also interacted considerably with the Departments of Linguistics and Brain and Cognitive Science. After my Ph.D., I was briefly a postdoctoral fellow and research associate in the Brain and Cognitive Science Department at MIT after which I joined Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill, NJ). I joined the The University of Chicago in 2000.  The interaction of computation and mathematics with brain and cognitive science continues to fascinate me. The particular interaction of learning and language has been the dominant theme of my research.",

Mcclelland is the Lucie Stern Professor at Stanford University, where he was formerly the chair of the Psychology Department.[1] He is best known for his work on statistical learning and Parallel Distributed Processing, applying connectionist models (or neural networks) to explain cognitive phenomena such as spoken word recognition and visual word recognition. McClelland is to a large extent responsible for the \"connectionist revolution\" of the 1980s, which saw a large increase in scientific interest for connectionism. McClelland born on December 1, 1948 to Walter Moore and Frances (Shaffer) McClelland. He received a B.A. in Psychology from Columbia University in 1970, and a Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975. He married Heidi Marsha Feldman on May 6, 1978, and has two daughters. In 1986 McClelland published Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition with David Rumelhart, which some still regard as a bible for cognitive scientists. His present work focuses on learning, memory processes, and psycholinguistics, still within the framework of connectionist models. He is a former chair of the Rumelhart Prize committee, having collaborated with Rumelhart for many years, and himself received the award in 2010 at the Cognitive Science Society Annual Conference in Portland, Oregon.  McClelland and David Rumelhart are known for their debate with Steven Pinker and Alan Prince regarding the necessity of a language-specific learning module.  In fall 2006 McClelland moved to Stanford University from Carnegie Mellon University, where he was a professor of psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. He also holds a part-time appointment as Consulting Professor at the Neuroscience and Aphasia Research Unit (NARU) within the School of Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester.",

My work tends to make heavy use of machine learning techniques, often using the human visual system as inspiration. For example, temporal processing is a key component of human perception, but is still relatively unexploited in current visual recognition systems. Machine learning from big (visual) data allows systems to learn subtle statistical regularities of the visual world. But humans have the ability to learn from very few examples. Here's a recent talk (from 2015) that discusses some thoughts on these issues.",

Professor G\u00e9rard Dreyfus, advisor.  Ph.D. degree in Electrical Engineering in December 1988. 1981-1985:  Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure de Physique et Chimie, Paris, France.  Engineering diploma in physics and chemistry in June 1985.  Master degree in electrical engineering in June 1985.  Additional Information  Born August 15., 1961, in Paris (France).  Married, three children.  Citizenships: French and Swiss.  Permanent US Resident.  Languages: French, English, Spanish.  Computer Skills include: C/C++, Java, Lisp, Windows and MS Office, Unix, HTML, XML, Perl, CGI, Adobe Photoshop, Matlab.  Hobbies: Painting, ski touring, Flamenco dancing.  My Projects:  Pattern Classification and Machine Learning:  Optimum Margin Classifiers and Support Vector Machines: A new technique of classification, which leaves the largest possible margin on either side of the decision boundary, therefore reducing classification errors. Our invention was granted a US patent. Take a look at the impressive SVM application list. For further information, consult the kernel machines web site, the support vector machines web site, and the list of available SVM software. Optimum test set size: What is the minimum number of samples needed to estimate the performance of your classifier with a certain accuracy? Lambert Schomaker wrote an Applet based on the results of our research. Variable and feature selection: Methods for selecting just a few variables relevant for classification, with applications to gene selection, drug discovery, text mining, and others. See the special issue of JMLR we co-edited and the benchmark on feature extraction we organized. See also the book we edited and the class we taught. Biometrics, Genomics, Proteomics and Cancer research:  Fingerprint verification: Your fingerprint may be stored on your credit card in the future. We devised a method to represent fingerprints in a compact way using directional and frequency maps. Writer identification: Handwriting has always been used by forensic experts for law enforcement purpose. Fighting against terrorism has recently incrased the needs for accurate writer indentification. We contributed to the design of the Wanda XML format, a new standard to store and annotate handwriting pieces of evidence. Gene selection: A project to discover genes that may be connected to cancer or other diseases by analyzing patterns of gene expression obtained from DNA microarrays. A patent is pending on our invention of RFE-SVM (Recursive Feature Elimination SVM). Diagnosis from protein profiles: Gene activity monitors only indirectly protein regulation. Disease states can be better assessed by profiling protein amounts directly. We use antibody array and mass-spectrometry data to help diagnosing disease, including cancer. Handwriting Recognition and Pen Computing:  UNIPEN: A project of data exchange and benchmark for on-line handwritten data. On-line Handwriting Recognizer: A program that can recognize handprinted and cursive words using Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). A US patent was granted to our application of TDNNs. Cursive handwriting teacher: A program which measures how well formed your cursive handwriting is. Handwriting Synthesizer: A program that synthesizes text with your own handwriting, given an ASCII file. Language model: A program which learns the statistics of English using Variable Memory Length Markov Models (VLMM) and Weighted Finite State Transductions (WFST). Such models are used, in particular, as handwriting recognition postprocessors. Wanda: A framework for writer identification with forensic applications. Organization of workshops and challenges",

Previously I was an RCUK Academic Fellow at Leeds and before that a Research Fellow in the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, where I worked on the EU-funded CLASS and CogViSys projects with Andrew Zisserman. I was a Fulford Junior Research Fellow of Somerville College. I completed my PhD in Computer Vision at the Department of Computer Science, University of Bristol, and received my BSc in Computer Science from the University of Manchester.  My primary research interests are in high-level understanding of images and video, with an emphasis on probabilistic approaches derived by statistical learning from examples. One application of this work investigated during my PhD has been a mobility aid for the severely visually impaired. My work in this domain has led to applications of probabilistic approaches in other areas such as object extraction from video sequences, and formal methods for evaluating complex vision techniques such as image segmentation algorithms. More recently my research has focused on methods for recognizing objects, people and their pose and behaviour in unconstrained consumer  images and video. A central theme to this work has been the exploitation of \"weak\" but readily-available sources of supervision, with examples including learning models for face recognition from video scripts and subtitles, learning to recognize object categories from textual descriptions alone, learning sign language by \"watching TV\", and learning articulated pose estimation from inaccurate Mechanical Turk annotation.  I am co-organizer of the PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge. I have served as an area chair for the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) and the European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), and regularly review for all the main conferences and journals.
