From 1961 to 1990 he worked at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow, where he became Head of the Computer Science Research Department. He then joined AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, having been appointed Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at Royal Holloway in 1995.  Professor Vapnik has taught and researched in computer science, theoretical and applied statistics for over 30 years. He has published 6 monographs and over a hundred research papers. His major achievements have been the development of a general theory of minimizing the expected risk using empirical data and a new type of learning machine called Support Vector machine that possesses a high level of generalization ability. These techniques have been used to solve many pattern recognition and regression estimation problems and have been applied to the problems of dependency estimation, forecasting, and constructing intelligent machines. His current research is presented in his latest books \"Statistical Learning Theory\", Wiley, 1998, and \"The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory\", second edition, Springer, 2000.  He was one of the invited speakers at the Colloquium \"The Importance of being Learnable\" hosted by the Computer Learning Research Centre at Royal Holloway in September 1998.  On the 10th of February 2006 the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) of USA elected Professor Vapnik as a new member for \"insights into the fundamental complexities of learning and for inventing practical and widely applied machine-learning algorithms\".  The citation states that:  \"Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions.

    "BIO": "Paul is the Development Manager for Whole Page Relevance (WPR) at Bing.  His team provides the glue between the frontend \u201cUX\u201d and backend \u201cweb relevance\u201d.  Among other features, the WPR team provides query suggestions, determines how results are arranged on the page, and measures overall user satisfaction.     Paul came to Microsoft as a Researcher in 2002.  Before moving to Search, Paul and his team worked on numerous efforts to use machine learning in the analysis of documents, emails, and web pages.  Results of this work can be seen in products like Windows, Live Search, and Microsoft Dynamics.  In collaboration with the Live Toolbar team we built the technology behind \u201csmart menus\u201d.  The Tablet PC team uses our technology to extract the structure in handwritten ink notes.  East Asian Office is using his technology to extract contact information from incoming emails.  Dynamics/CRM is using his technology to automatically route and analyze incoming faxes.   Live Search uses similar technology to classify and extract information from documents and queries.     Paul has served on the program committees of conferences such as Neural Information Process Systems (NIPS), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), and the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).  He has received the Marr Prize for the best paper in computer vision (at ICCV 2003).  An earlier paper on medical image processing received an honorable mention for the Marr prize in 1995.  He received an honorable mention for best paper at AAAI 2004. While at MIT he received the NSF Career award as one of the top junior faculty members in Computer Science.     Paul\u2019s interest in intelligent systems goes back quite a ways.  As an IBM intern in 1986, Paul Viola constructed a semi-autonomous robotic wheel chair called \u201cMr. Ed\u201d.  This ride-on robot incorporated sensors and a microprocessor,  and required no more than coarse and infrequent feedback to navigate a hallway,  or go through a doorway.  Until 1990,  he studied robotics with Rod Brooks at MIT.  There he received a master\u2019s degree for the construction of an autonomous visual robot patterned on the simple mammalian oculomotor processes.  After brief forays into neuroscience and structural molecular biology (at Arris Phamaceutical now Axys), Paul returned to MIT to complete his Ph.D. on biomedical image processing.     Paul\u2019s thesis work on the registration of images from various medical sensors has been widely used and reimplemented (his thesis has been referenced more than 800 times).  It is now a standard technique that appears in many commercial products,  and is widely considered the best and most reliable registration technique for assistance in surgical planning.       In 1995, Dr. Viola returned to MIT as an assistant professor and later an associate professor.  His work focused on statistical learning for image processing and computer vision.   In the area of computer graphics his work with Jeremy De Bonet is considered the first effective texture synthesis algorithm for complex textural patterns.  Other work included techniques for image database retrieval and 3D reconstruction.     While visiting Compaq Cambridge research labs in 2000,  he created the world\u2019s first real-time face detection system.  This system has been widely adopted and reimplemented: Intel distributes this algorithm in a computer vision toolkit;  MSRA has adopted and improved the algorithm.  Though it was developed outside of MS, it is actually in wide use inside of MSR (as well as many other companies and universities).  After leaving MIT to join the Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, he worked on face recognition, surveillance, and real-time computer vision. ",

    "BIO": "I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Prof. Luc Van Gool's group. My main interests are object detection and tracking from moving platforms in urban scenarios, as well as SLAM and 3D reconstruction.  When observing a traffic scene from inside a vehicle, a human observer will usually pay attention to a multitude of different scene objects in parallel: one can identify other traffic agents such as cars and pedestrians, and predict their further motion, or even interpret their intention. At the same time, one needs to stay clear of any obstacles, remain on the assigned road, and read/interpret any traffic signs on the side of street. On top that, a human is able to assess the situation: when close to a school or pedestrian crossing, one ideally will adapt one's driving behavior.  While humans seem to be able to perform all these tasks in parallel without too much effort, urban scene analysis remains a difficult task for a computer. To this end, I have been working on various projects towards this goal, mostly looking at specific sub-problems and combining them in a system's perspective.  Most of my work has been published at major conferences/journals in the Computer Vision and Robotics communities. Together with my co-authors Bastian Leibe, Konrad Schindler, and Luc Van Gool, we have obtained the Best Vision Paper Award at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), held in Kobe, May 2009! The rewarded work finds and tracks pedestrians in realistic shopping street environments, from a mobile platform (either a car or a robot-like platform).",

    "BIO": "David Haussler (born 1953) is an American bioinformatician known for his work leading the team that assembled the first human genome sequence in the race to complete the Human Genome Project and subsequently for compDavid Haussler\u2019s research lies at the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology. He develops new statistical and algorithmic methods to explore the molecular function and evolution of the human genome, integrating cross-species comparative and high-throughput genomics data to study gene structure, function, and regulation. He is credited with pioneering the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs), stochastic context-free grammars, and the discriminative kernel method for analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. He was the first to apply the latter methods to the genome-wide search for gene expression biomarkers in cancer, now a major effort of his laboratory.  As a collaborator on the international Human Genome Project, his team posted the first publicly available computational assembly of the human genome sequence on the Internet on July 7, 2000. Following this, his team developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a web-based tool that is used extensively in biomedical research and serves as the platform for several large-scale genomics projects, including NHGRI\u2019s ENCODE project to use omics methods to explore the function of every base in the human genome, NIH\u2019s Mammalian Gene Collection, NHGRI\u2019s 1000 genomes project to explore human genetic variation, and NCI\u2019s Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to explore the genomic changes in cancer.  His group\u2019s informatics work on cancer genomics, including the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, provides a complete analysis pipeline from raw DNA reads through the detection and interpretation of mutations and altered gene expression in tumor samples. His group collaborates with researchers at medical centers nationally, including members of the Stand Up To Cancer \u201cDream Teams\u201d and the Cancer Genome Atlas, to discover molecular causes of cancer and pioneer a new personalized, genomics-based approach to cancer treatment.  The UCSC Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a product of the Haussler lab, is a secure repository for storing, cataloging, and accessing cancer genome sequences, alignments, and mutation information for 25 cancer types from TCGA, the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) project, and other related projects. The current planned capacity of this data center is five petabytes. The CGHub will serve as a platform to aggregate other large-scale cancer genomics information, growing to provide the statistical power to attack the complexity of cancer.  He co-founded the Genome 10K Project to assemble a genomic zoo\u2014a collection of DNA sequences representing the genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species\u2014to capture genetic diversity as a resource for the life sciences and for worldwide conservation efforts.  Haussler co-founded and co-chairs the Data Working Group of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, through which research, health care, and disease advocacy organizations that have taken the first steps to standardize and enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data.   Haussler received his PhD in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of AAAS and AAAI. He has won a number of awards, including the 2015 Dan David Prize, the 2011 Weldon Memorial Prize from University of Oxford, the 2009 ASHG Curt Stern Award in Human Genetics, the 2008 Senior Scientist Accomplishment Award from the International Society for Computational Biology, the 2005 Dickson Prize for Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award in Artificial Intelligence.",

I quickly came to like the new country, especially the friendly people and the exciting weather (both blizzards and 100-degree days are things one rarely encounters in Germany). While at Cornell, I met my wife Amy Briggs, whom I followed to Middlebury to teach computer science. My research is in computer vision, the field concerned with analyzing images (which might be taken with a video camera). I'm particularly interested in stereo vision, i.e., extracting 3D information from two 2D images. (Take CS 453 if you want to learn more about this!) I'm also interested in computer graphics and computer architecture. I have great fun teaching computer science, in particular how to program. Having to achieve the \"perfection\" required to write a working program can be a mind-bending intellectual experience!  To get my mind off work, I love to play music. My main instrument is the drums, but I also play many other instruments (with varying levels of skill :). At Middlebury I play \"Vermonto-Rican Folk-Rock for the Hard-of-Hearing\" with The Doughboys, and also with the jazz/latin/fusion group Mogani and the band Soularium. While at Cornell, I was the drummer with the CS department's rock band Harmful if Swallowed.  I have fun inventing and building things, often with rather non-traditional applications. I have started a company that builds and sells digital sundials. I also enjoy juggling (with Profs. Schumer and Briggs), unicycling, and hiking and skiing in our lovely state.",

    "BIO": "Computational learning theory and related areas in probability theory, information theory, statistics and pattern recognition. Yoav Freund works on applications of machine learning algorithms in bioinformatics, computer vision, finance, network routing and high-performance computing. He has developed a new approach to the study and development of machine learning algorithms, where the goal is to produce a good decision algorithm for a repetitive decision task. A decision algorithm receives as input an instance (sensory data) and outputs a decision (an action). After the decision has been made, there is a measurable outcome. Freund's main focus is on binary classification tasks, where the decision is binary, the outcome is binary, and the loss is 1 if the decision and outcome don't match and 0 if they do. Given these definitions and a source of instances and outcomes, Freund can evaluate the performance of any decision algorithm--treating it as a \"black box\". The practical advantage of the black-box approach is that it provides a measuring stick for comparing all types of decision algorithms, regardless of how they are constructed or analyzed. By extension, this approach produces a way of comparing all types of learning algorithms. Capsule Bio: Yoav Freund is a professor of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. His work is in the area of machine learning, computational statistics and their applications. Dr. Freund is an internationally known researcher in the field of machine learning, a field which bridges computer science and statistics. He is best known for his joint work with Dr. Robert Schapire on the Adaboost algorithm.

My work tends to make heavy use of machine learning techniques, often using the human visual system as inspiration. For example, temporal processing is a key component of human perception, but is still relatively unexploited in current visual recognition systems. Machine learning from big (visual) data allows systems to learn subtle statistical regularities of the visual world. But humans have the ability to learn from very few examples. Here's a recent talk (from 2015) that discusses some thoughts on these issues.",

    "BIO": "I studied Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi where a thesis on the automatic recognition of beats on the Tabla got me interested in the themes of perception, recognition, learning on the one hand and acoustics, music, and language on the other. I came to study at the Laboratory for Computer Science at MIT where I completed a master's thesis on speech recognition. A taste for theoretical problems and a desire to better understand fundamental possibilities and limitations of automatic learning and recognition by a computer led me to a Ph.D. in learning theory that I submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT. During the MIT years, I also interacted considerably with the Departments of Linguistics and Brain and Cognitive Science. After my Ph.D., I was briefly a postdoctoral fellow and research associate in the Brain and Cognitive Science Department at MIT after which I joined Bell Laboratories (Murray Hill, NJ). I joined the The University of Chicago in 2000.  The interaction of computation and mathematics with brain and cognitive science continues to fascinate me. The particular interaction of learning and language has been the dominant theme of my research.",

My research in data mining is focused on developing innovative new algorithms for a variety of data mining problems including clustering, classification, pattern discovery, and deviation detection, with an emphasis on business applications and information retrieval. My research in bio-informatics is focused on developing algorithms for understanding the function of genes and proteins in different species using data arising from genome-wide expression #s. In this work, I'm trying to use data mining techniques to analyze expression #s of genes and find groups of genes that behave similarly, and determine the underlying genetic regulatory network. My research in parallel processing is focused on developing scalable parallel algorithms for emerging applications and architectures. This includes research on data intensive applications, scientific computing, architectures with deep memory hierarchies, and architectures with heterogeneous interconnection networks. My recent research has led to the development of a number of highly efficient and scalable software packages and algorithms such as METIS (a serial sparse graph partitioning software), ParMETIS (an MPI-based parallel graph partitioning software), hMETIS (a circuit partitioning software), PSPASES (a parallel direct solver), and CHAMELEON (a spatial clustering algorithm).",

He is Associate Professor at Brigham Young University's Marriott School of Management, where he teaches the core MBA Operations course. He was on the faculty of the Harvard Business School from 2004-2010, where he taught the core MBA course in Technology and Operations Management, and he co-developed and taught the Operations Strategy elective course. He has taught in executive education programs at HBS, including Building Competitive Advantage through Operations (BCAO), Leading Product Innovation (LPI), and Senior Executive Program, China (SEPC). He has also taught executive education programs at UCLA, Tsinghua University, Chalmers University, University of Xiamen, Universidad de La Sabana (Bogot\u00e1), and many others. Professor Snow's research seeks to improve our understanding of technological innovation, and specifically of the complex relationship between new and old technologies that exists during technology transitions. While most work on technology and innovation has taken a \"neo-phillic\" approach, focusing largely on issues surrounding adoption of new and emerging technologies, Professor Snow's work highlights the economic and performance growth potential of \"old\" technologies. Many old technologies, from incandescent light bulbs, wood building products, and blackboards, to Apollo rocket motors, CISC computer chips, and lead-acid batteries, continue to prosper and improve at unexpectedly fast rates. Firms that rely on these and other old technologies face a unique set of challenges as they seek to improve their current offers. These challenges becomes even more complex for firms that rely on both old and new technologies. Snow's work seeks to improve scholarly understanding of the complex interplay between old and new technologies, and to provide managers with tools to navigate technology transitions effectively.  He holds a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Haas School of Business and an MBA from BYU's Marriott School of Management.

Dijkstra Prize in 2007 in recognition of some of her earliest work establishing the pillars on which every fault tolerant system has been built for a generation (Dwork, Lynch, and Stockmeyer, 1984).  <br>Her contributions to cryptography include the launching of non-malleable cryptography, the subfield of modern cryptography that studies -- and remedies -- the failures of cryptographic protocols to compose securely (Dolev, Dwork, and Naor, 1991).  She is a co-inventor of the first public-key cryptosystem based on lattices, the current best bet for cryptographic constructions that will remain secure even against quantum computers (Ajtai and Dwork, 1997). More recently, Dwork spearheaded a successful effort to place privacy-preserving analysis of data on a firm mathematical foundation.  A cornerstone of this effort is the invention of Differential Privacy (Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith, 2006, Dwork 2006), now the subject of intense activity in across many disciplines and recipient of the Theory of Cryptography Conference 2016 Test-of-Time award. With its introduction into Apple's iOS 10 (2016) and Google's Chrome browser (2014), differential privacy is just now beginning to be deployed on a global scale. <br>Differentially private analyses enjoy a strong form of stability.  One consequence is statistical validity under adaptive (aka exploratory) data analysis, which is of great value even when privacy is not itself a concern (Dwork, Feldman, Hardt, Pitassi, Reingold, and Roth 2014, 2015a, 2015b).<br>Dwork is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and the US National Academy of Engineering, and is a fellow of the ACM, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.",
