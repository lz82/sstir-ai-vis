    "BIO": "Professor Vapnik gained his Masters Degree in Mathematics in 1958 at Uzbek State University, Samarkand, USSR. From 1961 to 1990 he worked at the Institute of Control Sciences, Moscow, where he became Head of the Computer Science Research Department. He then joined AT&T Bell Laboratories, Holmdel, NJ, having been appointed Professor of Computer Science and Statistics at Royal Holloway in 1995.  Professor Vapnik has taught and researched in computer science, theoretical and applied statistics for over 30 years. He has published 6 monographs and over a hundred research papers. His major achievements have been the development of a general theory of minimizing the expected risk using empirical data and a new type of learning machine called Support Vector machine that possesses a high level of generalization ability. These techniques have been used to solve many pattern recognition and regression estimation problems and have been applied to the problems of dependency estimation, forecasting, and constructing intelligent machines. His current research is presented in his latest books \"Statistical Learning Theory\", Wiley, 1998, and \"The Nature of Statistical Learning Theory\", second edition, Springer, 2000.  He was one of the invited speakers at the Colloquium \"The Importance of being Learnable\" hosted by the Computer Learning Research Centre at Royal Holloway in September 1998.  On the 10th of February 2006 the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) of USA elected Professor Vapnik as a new member for \"insights into the fundamental complexities of learning and for inventing practical and widely applied machine-learning algorithms\".  The citation states that:  \"Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to \"engineering research, practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature,\" and to the \"pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education\".  In December 2011 Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (Tuebingen, Germany) organized \"Empirical Inference Symposium\" in honour of the 75th birthday anniversary of Professor Vapnik.",

    "BIO": "Paul is the Development Manager for Whole Page Relevance (WPR) at Bing.  His team provides the glue between the frontend \u201cUX\u201d and backend \u201cweb relevance\u201d.  Among other features, the WPR team provides query suggestions, determines how results are arranged on the page, and measures overall user satisfaction.     Paul came to Microsoft as a Researcher in 2002.  Before moving to Search, Paul and his team worked on numerous efforts to use machine learning in the analysis of documents, emails, and web pages.  Results of this work can be seen in products like Windows, Live Search, and Microsoft Dynamics.  In collaboration with the Live Toolbar team we built the technology behind \u201csmart menus\u201d.  The Tablet PC team uses our technology to extract the structure in handwritten ink notes.  East Asian Office is using his technology to extract contact information from incoming emails.  Dynamics/CRM is using his technology to automatically route and analyze incoming faxes.   Live Search uses similar technology to classify and extract information from documents and queries.     Paul has served on the program committees of conferences such as Neural Information Process Systems (NIPS), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), and the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV).  He has received the Marr Prize for the best paper in computer vision (at ICCV 2003).  An earlier paper on medical image processing received an honorable mention for the Marr prize in 1995.  He received an honorable mention for best paper at AAAI 2004. While at MIT he received the NSF Career award as one of the top junior faculty members in Computer Science.     Paul\u2019s interest in intelligent systems goes back quite a ways.  As an IBM intern in 1986, Paul Viola constructed a semi-autonomous robotic wheel chair called \u201cMr. Ed\u201d.  This ride-on robot incorporated sensors and a microprocessor,  and required no more than coarse and infrequent feedback to navigate a hallway,  or go through a doorway.  Until 1990,  he studied robotics with Rod Brooks at MIT.  There he received a master\u2019s degree for the construction of an autonomous visual robot patterned on the simple mammalian oculomotor processes.  After brief forays into neuroscience and structural molecular biology (at Arris Phamaceutical now Axys), Paul returned to MIT to complete his Ph.D. on biomedical image processing.     Paul\u2019s thesis work on the registration of images from various medical sensors has been widely used and reimplemented (his thesis has been referenced more than 800 times).  It is now a standard technique that appears in many commercial products,  and is widely considered the best and most reliable registration technique for assistance in surgical planning.       In 1995, Dr. Viola returned to MIT as an assistant professor and later an associate professor.  His work focused on statistical learning for image processing and computer vision.   In the area of computer graphics his work with Jeremy De Bonet is considered the first effective texture synthesis algorithm for complex textural patterns.  Other work included techniques for image database retrieval and 3D reconstruction.     While visiting Compaq Cambridge research labs in 2000,  he created the world\u2019s first real-time face detection system.  This system has been widely adopted and reimplemented: Intel distributes this algorithm in a computer vision toolkit;  MSRA has adopted and improved the algorithm.  Though it was developed outside of MS, it is actually in wide use inside of MSR (as well as many other companies and universities).  After leaving MIT to join the Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs, he worked on face recognition, surveillance, and real-time computer vision. ",

    "BIO": "I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Prof. Luc Van Gool's group. My main interests are object detection and tracking from moving platforms in urban scenarios, as well as SLAM and 3D reconstruction.  When observing a traffic scene from inside a vehicle, a human observer will usually pay attention to a multitude of different scene objects in parallel: one can identify other traffic agents such as cars and pedestrians, and predict their further motion, or even interpret their intention. At the same time, one needs to stay clear of any obstacles, remain on the assigned road, and read/interpret any traffic signs on the side of street. On top that, a human is able to assess the situation: when close to a school or pedestrian crossing, one ideally will adapt one's driving behavior.  While humans seem to be able to perform all these tasks in parallel without too much effort, urban scene analysis remains a difficult task for a computer. To this end, I have been working on various projects towards this goal, mostly looking at specific sub-problems and combining them in a system's perspective.  Most of my work has been published at major conferences/journals in the Computer Vision and Robotics communities. Together with my co-authors Bastian Leibe, Konrad Schindler, and Luc Van Gool, we have obtained the Best Vision Paper Award at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), held in Kobe, May 2009! The rewarded work finds and tracks pedestrians in realistic shopping street environments, from a mobile platform (either a car or a robot-like platform).",

Then, I spent two unbelievably wonderful years as a postdoc at UC Berkeley under Jitendra Malik. From Berkeley, I spent just over one year as a Researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond. Now, I'm off on a new adventure as a Research Scientist with the terrific group of researchers and engineers in Facebook AI Research (FAIR).   My main research interests are in computer vision, AI, and machine learning. I'm particularly focused on building models for object detection and recognition. These models aim to incorporate the \"right\" biases so that machine learning algorithms can understand image content from moderate to large-scale datasets. I always have an eye towards fast systems that work well in practice.   During my Ph.D., I spent time as a research intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK working on human pose estimation from (Kinect) depth images. I also participated in several first-place entries into the PASCAL VOC object detection challenge, and was awarded a \"lifetime achievement\" prize for my work on deformable part models. I think this refers to the lifetime of the PASCAL challenge\u2014and not mine!",

    "BIO": "David Haussler (born 1953) is an American bioinformatician known for his work leading the team that assembled the first human genome sequence in the race to complete the Human Genome Project and subsequently for compDavid Haussler\u2019s research lies at the interface of mathematics, computer science, and molecular biology. He develops new statistical and algorithmic methods to explore the molecular function and evolution of the human genome, integrating cross-species comparative and high-throughput genomics data to study gene structure, function, and regulation. He is credited with pioneering the use of hidden Markov models (HMMs), stochastic context-free grammars, and the discriminative kernel method for analyzing DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. He was the first to apply the latter methods to the genome-wide search for gene expression biomarkers in cancer, now a major effort of his laboratory.  As a collaborator on the international Human Genome Project, his team posted the first publicly available computational assembly of the human genome sequence on the Internet on July 7, 2000. Following this, his team developed the UCSC Genome Browser, a web-based tool that is used extensively in biomedical research and serves as the platform for several large-scale genomics projects, including NHGRI\u2019s ENCODE project to use omics methods to explore the function of every base in the human genome, NIH\u2019s Mammalian Gene Collection, NHGRI\u2019s 1000 genomes project to explore human genetic variation, and NCI\u2019s Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to explore the genomic changes in cancer.  His group\u2019s informatics work on cancer genomics, including the UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser, provides a complete analysis pipeline from raw DNA reads through the detection and interpretation of mutations and altered gene expression in tumor samples. His group collaborates with researchers at medical centers nationally, including members of the Stand Up To Cancer \u201cDream Teams\u201d and the Cancer Genome Atlas, to discover molecular causes of cancer and pioneer a new personalized, genomics-based approach to cancer treatment.  The UCSC Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a product of the Haussler lab, is a secure repository for storing, cataloging, and accessing cancer genome sequences, alignments, and mutation information for 25 cancer types from TCGA, the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) project, and other related projects. The current planned capacity of this data center is five petabytes. The CGHub will serve as a platform to aggregate other large-scale cancer genomics information, growing to provide the statistical power to attack the complexity of cancer.  He co-founded the Genome 10K Project to assemble a genomic zoo\u2014a collection of DNA sequences representing the genomes of 10,000 vertebrate species\u2014to capture genetic diversity as a resource for the life sciences and for worldwide conservation efforts.  Haussler co-founded and co-chairs the Data Working Group of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health, through which research, health care, and disease advocacy organizations that have taken the first steps to standardize and enable secure sharing of genomic and clinical data.   Haussler received his PhD in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of AAAS and AAAI. He has won a number of awards, including the 2015 Dan David Prize, the 2011 Weldon Memorial Prize from University of Oxford, the 2009 ASHG Curt Stern Award in Human Genetics, the 2008 Senior Scientist Accomplishment Award from the International Society for Computational Biology, the 2005 Dickson Prize for Science from Carnegie Mellon University, and the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award in Artificial Intelligence.",

He received his university education from Rhodes University, South Africa (BS), University of Cape Town (MS), and Stanford University (Ph.D Statistics 1984).  His first employment was with the South African Medical Research Council in 1977, during which time he earned his MS from UCT. In 1979 he spent a year interning at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas, and the Biomath department at Oxford University. He joined the Ph.D program at Stanford University in 1980. After graduating from Stanford in 1984, he returned to South Africa for a year with his earlier employer SA Medical Research Council. He returned to the USA in March 1986 and joined the statistics and data analysis research group at what was then AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. After eight years at Bell Labs, he returned to Stanford University in 1994 as Professor in Statistics and Biostatistics. In 2013 he was named the John A. Overdeck Professor of Mathematical Sciences.  His main research contributions have been in applied statistics, and he has written three books in this area: \"Generalized Additive Models\" (with R. Tibshirani, Chapman and Hall, 1991), \"Elements of Statistical Learning\" (with R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman, Springer 2001; second edition 2009) and \"An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R\" (with G. James, D. Witten and R. Tibshirani, Springer 2013). He has also made contributions in statistical computing, co-editing (with J. Chambers) a large software library on modeling tools in the S language (\"Statistical Models in S\", Wadsworth, 1992), which form the foundation for much of the statistical modeling in R. His current research focuses on applied statistical modeling and prediction problems in biology and genomics, medicine and industry.",

I lived in Capetown for three months in 1994 working as a volunteer at the Grassroots Educare Trust. In 1990 I went to King's College, Cambridge University, to read maths. I had a great time there, and got the opportunity to design some posters (lots of big images).

I currently hold two research professorships: one at the Research Institute of Information and Language Processing in the University of Wolverhampton, the other at the Bristol Centre for Linguistics in the University of the West of England (UWE, Bristol). From 1990 to 2000 I was chief editor of current English dictionaries at Oxford University Press. In the 1980s I was project manager of the first edition of the Cobuild dictionary and chief editor of Collins English dictionaries.  My research interests are:  a) lexical analysis: mapping meaning onto phraseological patterns;  b) analysis of intentional lexical irregularities i.e. creative and innovative use of language;  c) similes, comparisons, and metaphors; d) personal names: origin and history of family names; convention and creativity in name giving.  With colleagues based at UWE, I am currently working on an AHRC-funded database of all the family names in the UK (FaNUK), with information about their linguistic and social origins, history, and geographical distribution.",

My research interests are    Image Recognition, that is, given a query image we want to find the closest image in a very large database. We currently have two systems, one with very low query-times and geometric verifivation on 50000 images and one for larger databases. Currently our largest database is 110 million images. The larger system is running from disk while still maintaining a decent query-time (sub 6s, on average).   Solving Minimal Problems for structure and motion. This was the main topic of my thesis. Minimal solvers are useful for building structure from motion systems. They also provide an excellent excuse for a computer vision researcher to use elegant mathematics.   3D reconstruction.

After graduating I became a Research Assistant at the Electrical Engineering Department of Cambridge University, England where I was a member of large team working on a speech understanding system. I took up a position as Lecturer in Computer Science in 1987. In 1993 I was appointed Senior Lecturer.  Research Interests  My research interests are fairly broad. I have always held an interest in Computer Speech and have supervised several projects at Waikato on that topic, in particular, speech recognition and speech compression. I currently have two PhD students working on speech compression. I am part of the Department's Machine Learning group where I concentrate my efforts on the application of Machine Learning to agricultural domains.

    "BIO": "I grew up in Germany, and moved to the United States in 1990 to join the PhD program in Computer Science at Cornell University. I quickly came to like the new country, especially the friendly people and the exciting weather (both blizzards and 100-degree days are things one rarely encounters in Germany). While at Cornell, I met my wife Amy Briggs, whom I followed to Middlebury to teach computer science. My research is in computer vision, the field concerned with analyzing images (which might be taken with a video camera). I'm particularly interested in stereo vision, i.e., extracting 3D information from two 2D images. (Take CS 453 if you want to learn more about this!) I'm also interested in computer graphics and computer architecture. I have great fun teaching computer science, in particular how to program. Having to achieve the \"perfection\" required to write a working program can be a mind-bending intellectual experience!  To get my mind off work, I love to play music. My main instrument is the drums, but I also play many other instruments (with varying levels of skill :). At Middlebury I play \"Vermonto-Rican Folk-Rock for the Hard-of-Hearing\" with The Doughboys, and also with the jazz/latin/fusion group Mogani and the band Soularium. While at Cornell, I was the drummer with the CS department's rock band Harmful if Swallowed.  I have fun inventing and building things, often with rather non-traditional applications. I have started a company that builds and sells digital sundials. I also enjoy juggling (with Profs. Schumer and Briggs), unicycling, and hiking and skiing in our lovely state.",
